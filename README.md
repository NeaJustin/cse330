# cse330 taught by Dr. Kay Zemoudeh
Data Structures Course Work for implementing strings, vectors, lists, set, priority queue, unordered_maps with buckets. 
It also included learning a little bit about time complexity. Not in depth of how it works but the overall basis of it. Going through the code and seeing how optimized it is and what could be done to further improve upon the algorithm. 
There are also homeworks listed that were apart from the labs and helped put what was being taught in the course into practice outside of labs.
